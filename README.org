* Time Blocking Script
A Python script to streamline time blocking. It accepts a user's schedule in text form, interprets each line as an event, and transforms it into an .ics file for seamless import into any calendar app.

** Purpose
Time blocking is a time management technique that involves dividing your day into blocks of time, each dedicated to a specific task. Basically, it's about calendaring your to-do list.

In practice, time blocking involves planning your day in advance, usually by listing all of the tasks you need to complete and then assigning a specific time slot for each task. For example, you might block off 9 am - 11 am for writing a report, 11 am - 12 pm for responding to emails, 1 pm - 2 pm for a meeting, and so on.

Time blocking can help you manage your time more efficiently, reduce distractions and interruptions, and ensure that high-priority tasks get the attention they deserve. It also provides a clear structure for your day, which can reduce stress and decision fatigue.

Time blocking is different from time boxing.

1. **Time Blocking:** This method involves scheduling specific tasks to be done within certain periods (or blocks) of time throughout your day. For instance, you might schedule 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM for writing, 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM for responding to emails, etc. The focus here is more on the tasks to be accomplished during each block of time, and these blocks can be adjusted based on the nature and duration of each task.

2. **Time Boxing:** This technique involves allotting a fixed amount of time, or a "box" of time, to each task, after which you move on to the next task whether the current task is completed or not. For example, you could decide to dedicate exactly one hour to brainstorming ideas for a project, after which you would move on to the next task, regardless of whether you've finished brainstorming or not. The primary goal of time boxing is to prevent tasks from dragging on and consuming more time than they should.

Time blocking is about organizing your day into blocks of time dedicated to certain tasks, whereas time boxing is about limiting the amount of time you spend on any given task.

** Features
- Accepts schedule input from the clipboard or directly via the console.
- Parses the schedule to extract task start times, durations, and titles.
- Accommodates variations in the input format, such as the absence of "am/pm" or a preceding space before "am/pm".
- Generates a calendar of events based on the provided schedule.
- Presents the proposed schedule in an easy-to-read format with color-coded elements, aligning the event titles for readability.
- Prompts for confirmation before saving the schedule to an .ics file.
- Automatically opens the .ics file after creation.

** Requirements
Requires the following Python libraries:

- pyperclip
- ics
- python-dateutil
- termcolor

You can install these libraries with pip:

#+begin_src sh
pip install pyperclip ics python-dateutil termcolor
#+end_src

** Installation
To install and run the script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
: git clone https://github.com/incandescentman/primetime.git

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
: cd primetime

3. Ensure you have the required Python libraries. You can install them with pip:
#+begin_src sh
pip install pyperclip ics python-dateutil termcolor
#+end_src

4. Run the script:
  python time_blocking.py

** Usage
To use the script, run it and paste your schedule when prompted, or copy your schedule to the clipboard before running the script.

Your schedule should follow this format:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
6:30pm work on book 30 minutes
7pm go to gym
8:30 pm meditate
9pm shower
9:30pm meet Jenny
10:00 comedy show
11 get a drink
11:30 pm go home
#+END_EXAMPLE

Or this format:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
5:00pm - Work on book for 90 minutes
6:30pm - Meditate for 30 minutes
7:00pm - Cook for 1 hour
8:00pm - Take a shower
8:30pm - Clean apartment
10:00pm - Prepare for comedy show
10:30pm - Attend comedy show
12:00am - Reflect on day, plan tomorrow
#+END_EXAMPLE

Each line should represent a single event. The event's start time should precede its title. If you want to specify the event's duration, add it at the end of the line in the "X minutes" format, where X represents the duration in minutes. If no duration is specified for an event, the script presumes the event concludes 10 minutes before the subsequent event's start time or at the next hour if it's the last event.

The script assumes all events take place today, before midnight.

After entering your schedule, hit RETURN twice to signal the end of input. The script will then present the proposed schedule and prompt for your confirmation. If you confirm, it will save the schedule as an .ics file and open it.
